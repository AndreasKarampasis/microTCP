Established in Athens in 1924 by Greek refugees from Constantinople in the 
wake of the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922), AEK has become one of the three
most popular clubs in Greece and the Greek diaspora and one of the three most
successful teams in Greek football (including Olympiacos and Panathinaikos),
winning 32 national titles and the only one to have won all the competitions
organised by the Hellenic Football Federation (12 Championships, 15 Greek Cups,
1 League Cup and 2 Super Cups. The club has appeared several times in European
competitions (UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League and the defunct UEFA Cup Winners' Cup).
It is the only Greek team to have reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup (1976–77) 
and the first Greek team to compete in the group stage of the UEFA Champions League (1994–95) 
and also to have reached the quarter-finals of the European Cup (1968–69) and the quarter-finals 
of the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup twice (1996–97 and 1997–98). 

History
Creation and early years (1924–1944)

The large Greek population of Constantinople, not unlike those of the other Ottoman urban centres, 
continued its athletic traditions in the form of numerous athletic clubs. Clubs such as Énosis 
Tatavlon and Iraklis from the Tatavla district, Megas Alexandros and Ermis of Galata, and Olympias
of Therapia existed to promote Hellenic athletic and cultural ideals. hese were amongst a dozen Greek-backed 
clubs that dominated the sporting landscape of the city in the years preceding World War I. 
After the war, with the influx of mainly French and British soldiers to Constantinople, many of the city's clubs 
participated in regular competition with teams formed by the foreign troops. Taxim, Pera, and Tatavla became 
the scene of weekly competitions in not only football, but also athletics, cycling, boxing, and tennis.
Of the clubs in the city, football was dominated by Énosis Tatávlon and Ermís. Ermís, one of the most popular 
sports clubs, was formed in 1875 by the Greek community of Pera (Galata).
Known as "Pera" since the mid 1880s, and "The Greek Football Team" when its football department was formed in 1914,
it was forced to change its name to "Pera Sports Club", and then "Beyoğluspor Kulübü" in 1923. Many of its athletes,
and those of most other sporting clubs, fled during the population exchanges at the end of the Greco-Turkish War, 
and settled in Athens and Thessaloniki.

UEFA Europa League unbeaten run and Greek Champions
The third season back in the top flight began with a tough draw in the Champions League Third 
qualifying round versus CSKA Moscow losing 3–0 on aggregate. The loss meant AEK were demoted to the Europa League 
play-off round where they were pitted versus Belgians Club Brugge. A 0–0 draw in Brugge in the first leg and a 3–0 win
in the return in Athens meant that AEK qualified for the group stages of a major European competition for the first 
time in 6 years.[100] They were seeded in pot 4 and were drawn along with AC Milan, HNK Rijeka and Austria Wien.
AEK would go on to qualify for the round of 32 undefeated, a statement that solidified their return as one of Europe's
elite teams, with a record of 1 win and 5 draws, the most notable being the two back to back 0–0 draws versus AC
Milan.[101] In the Round of 32 AEK were drawn against Ukrainian giants Dynamo Kyiv. AEK were better than their
opponents, but also were unlucky and lost after two draws and on away goal rule. The first match took place in Athens,
with a 1–1 draw and the second game in Kyiv, finished 0–0.[102][103] In April, AEK won their 12th Greek championship,
by recording a 2–0 home win against Levadiakos in front of 60,000 fans. This was their first championship after 24 years.
AEK were crowned champions in front of 14,500 of their fans in the last matchday against Apollon Smyrnis at
Georgios Kamaras Stadium.
2018–19 season was the season that AEK returned to the groups of the UEFA Champions League, for the 5th time
in the club's history after eliminating Celtic (3–2 on aggregate) and MOL Vidi (3–2 on aggregate) in the qualifying
stages. Led by former Panathinaikos' manager, Marinos Ouzounidis, AEK was drawn against Bayern Munich,
Benfica and Ajax and failed to make an impact after losing all 6 matches in the group stage.
Key-players Jakob Johansson, Lazaros Christodoulopoulos, Sergio Araujo and Ognjen Vranješ as well as manager
Manolo Jiménez that were essential to the 2017–18 triumphant season left the club and most transfers failed to 
add up to the team. Greek international Marios Oikonomou and Argentine striker Ezequiel Ponce were the only newcomers
that managed to make an impact to an overall disappointing season (3rd place, 23 points behind 1st PAOK and 18 points 
behind 2nd Olympiacos – third consecutive cup final loss from PAOK, 1–0)
2017–18 season's champions, Ognjen Vranješ and Sergio Araujo returned to Athens, and some other notable additions 
are Portuguese international Nélson Oliveira and Serbian midfielder Nenad Krstičić. 2019–20 season started 
catastrophically, with an early Europa League elimination from Turkish side Trabzonspor 
(1–3 in Athens, 0–2 in Trabzon, 3–3 on aggregate) and disappointing domestic results. New manager, Miguel 
Cardoso was sacked quickly to be replaced with club's veteran player and manager, Nikos Kostenoglou 
who was also later replaced by Italian manager, Massimo Carrera.
Under Carrera, AEK regained the confidence lost from the previous 1,5 years of bad results. 
Before the lockdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic AEK was 3rd in the regular season and in the semi-finals of 
the Greek Cup (2–1 home victory against Aris in the first leg). Afterwards going on to make it to the final for the 
fifth time in a row. However, they lost the final 1–0 to Olympiacos F.C.
After the draw for the Europa League third qualifying round, AEK Athens got VfL Wolfsburg at the Play-off 
round they won 2–1 at the Athens Olympic Stadium getting in the Group stage.[108] However, AEK's campaign 
results in the Europa league as well as the first half of the domestic Superleague were lacklustre, the European 
campaign being one of their worst ever, only recording 1 win in the group stages. In December, Massimo Carrera was 
relieved of his duties and replaced by Manolo Jiménez, previous Super League and Greek Cup winner with AEK – his fourth 
term at the club.
